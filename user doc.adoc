== How to write your own query ?

To get your custom result, you have to follow a simple syntax.
You don't have to feel lost, our auto-complexion syntax will guide you to write your queries.

First of all, you have to select your 2 hashtags. You must declare them following this syntax by giving a name, select your tags and a color :
[source,gtdsl]
----
tags myTags [ #tag1:color1, #tag2:color2 ].
----

.Be careful
[IMPORTANT]
====
Don't forget the brackets around the values and the comma between them !
====

Then, it's time to choose the countries where you're looking for the results.
Select a name for the region, en choose a list of countries : 
[source,gtdsl]
----
countries myName [ country1, country2, country3, ... ]
----

Next to that, you got to write a short sentence with your previous choice :
[source,gtdsl]
----
map myMapName displays myTags in myName
----

.Don't forget!
